README
======

A. This package includes the following files.

|-- Starter.c
|-- Executor.c
|-- Executor.h
|-- Makefile
|-- README.txt [This file]


B. Use your designed makefile 
To compile the code and build the executable using the command 

systemprompt>  make

To remove the  executable files use

systemprompt>  make clean

To run the program use (assuming seed is 3) 

systemprompt> ./Starter 3

which will run the program and generate the outputs.


C. Answer the following questions (1 point each, select/type the right answer).

    1. Malloc allocates memory dynamically on heap? – True
    2. When dynamically allocating an integer array, Malloc takes the number of elements as the input? – False
    3. free() is defined inside which header file? – get_running_ratio()
    4. How many executable(s) are required to be generated by the Makefile for this assignment? – 3
    5. What command is used to call the default target in Makefile? – make

D. Example Outputs
[Starter]: With seed: 7
[Executor]: Number of iterations is 77
[Executor]: Iteration with maximum vowel count is 43
[Starter]: Running ratio: 0.241263

[Starter]: With seed: 91
[Executor]: Number of iterations is 85
[Executor]: Iteration with maximum vowel count is 59
[Starter]: Running ratio: 0.246685
